============= Problems compiling trackballs ===============


Q:  How do you make a distribution independent linux binary?
A:  Short answer, you don't. 
    Long answer: Try statically linking all the non-standard libraries (but not X11/GL), 
    the most important thing; hold your thumbs!


============= Graphic cards =============


Q:  The gamegraphics is very slow even though I have a whizbang 3D graphics card
A:  Do you have 3D acceleration working under X11? Make sure DRI is working properly
    and that the game is compiled against the X11 openGL drivers if you have compiled it
    yourself. To see if you have graphics acceleration working in your X-server use the 
    'glxinfo' program and look for the line "direct rendering: Yes".

============= General problems using trackballs ==============


Q:  Trackballs is leaking huge amounts of memory
A:  This seem to be caused by faulty openGL drivers. Try disabling hardware accelleration.


Q:  I have too little memory to run trackballs without swapping.
A:  There are alot of things affecting the memory usage of trackballs. Try using the commandline option
    '--low-memory' which uses 15megs less memory but makes switching screens slightly slower.

Q:  Sound is out of sync.
A:	Shutdown any sound servers you are running (eg. artsd or esd) when playing.
	Eg. run "skill artsd ; trackballs ; artswrapper"

Q:  I cannot change flags/colors in the editor as documented.
A:  This might be caused by using keyboard layout which needs shift to get the numbers 
   (eg. french). Try temporarily changing keyboard layout to Swedish or US.

Q:  I can't get trackballs to recognise my joystick
A:  Have you setup joystick support properly for your distribution. You can test if you have it
    working properly by using the command "jstest /dev/js0". Does it work? If not, some hints below:

    Assuming you are using a analog gameport joystick (most people are!). Make sure you have loaded all the proper
    joystick modules.
	
	modprobe ns558       # For the gameport
	modprobe joydev      # For general joystick support
	modprobe analog	     # The specific driver for this joystick

	Now, does it work with jstest? If not, make sure you have /dev/js* devices setup properly.
    
	chmod 0644 /dev/js?
	
	Still doesn't work? Ok, we need to delete the actual device nodes and recreate them.

	cd /dev
	rm js?
	mkdir input
	mknod input/js0 c 13 0
	mknod input/js1 c 13 1
	mknod input/js2 c 13 2
	mknod input/js3 c 13 3
	ln -s input/js0 js0
	ln -s input/js1 js1
	ln -s input/js2 js2
	ln -s input/js3 js3

	Does it work now? If not you'll have to be satisfied with using the mouse or keyboard... sorry =(

Q:  Sometimes when I'm playing with a joystick the ball just start rolling of in one direction
A:  You might have a broken joystick which gives incorrect wrapover's on your axises. Try using the '--repair-joystick' 
    option. Possibly in conjunction with '--debug-joystick'
